Hadoop provides various Output classes like DBOutputFormat, SequenceFileOutputFormat, TextOutputFormat, etc..It also provides flexibility to its developers to use APIs and extend some of the functionality to achieve organization goals. MapReduce default Output Format is TextOutputFormat, which writes (key, value) pairs on individual lines of text files.
